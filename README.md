The SQL script is creating a database structure for managing employee and department-related information.

#  Summary of Relationships:
Employees: Have details in the employees table.
Departments: Listed in the department table.
Managers: A specific relationship between employees and departments is recorded in the dept_manager table.
Salaries: Connected to employees in the salaries table.
Job Titles: Stored in the titles table, connected to employees through emp_title_id.
Employee Assignments: The dept_emp table links employees to their departments.

# Queries
The queries are examples of how you can extract useful information by combining, filtering, and grouping data from the tables. Each query has a specific goal, such as finding employees in a department, managers, or specific names, and uses SQL functions and clauses to achieve it.
